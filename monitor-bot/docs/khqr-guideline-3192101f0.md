# KHQR Guideline

## What is ABA KHQR?
A standardized QR code payment system overseen by the National Bank of Cambodia. It facilitates cashless transactions by allowing consumers and businesses to make and receive payments seamlessly using mobile banking apps or e-wallets. The system promotes digital payments, enhances financial inclusion, and ensures interoperability among different banks and payment service providers, making financial transactions more efficient and accessible across the country.

Merchants who implement KHQR are required to make adjustments or changes upon request by ABA or in compliance with the National Bank of Cambodia's requirements. Failure to do so may result in the suspension or termination of the service.

## Benefits of KHQR

### For Customers:
- No more confusion with multiple QR codes at checkout—just scan a single KHQR code.  
- Simply look for the **KHQR label** when making payments.  
- Use your preferred payment app, including the **Bakong App**, to pay at any location that supports KHQR.  

### For Merchants:
- **Save counter space**—display just one KHQR stand instead of multiple QR labels.  
- **Simple, fast, and secure** payment solution.  
- Accept payments from **anyone and any bank app** without the need for multiple bilateral contracts with different acquirers.
